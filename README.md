# 👋 Hi, I’m Zack

I'm an IT Engineering leader and a hands-on platform engineer focused on **container images, OpenShift, and enterprise-scale Linux Environments**. I sit at the intersaction of **engineering, operations and developer enablement**-building things that are secure, observable and boring in the best way.

## 🔧 What I Work On
- **Enterprise Container base images** (UBI, language runtimes, app platforms)
- **OpenShift / Kubernetes** platforms
- **Image security, SBOMs, and supply chain hygiene**
- **CI/CD pipelines** and artifact management (JFROG Artifactory)
- **Observability** with Grafana, Prometheus, and Splunk
- Linux-first workflows (Fedora, GNOME, CLI-heavy)

## 🧠 Areas of Interest
- Container image lifecycle analytics (who's using what, and why)
- Platform reliability and developer experience
- Secure-by-default infrastructure
- Automating the boring stuff so that teams can ship faster
- Modernizing legacy systems without breaking trust

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Platforms:** OpenShift, Kubernetes
**Containers:** Podman, Buildah, Docker
**Languages:** Python, Bash, Go (learning), Rust-curious
**Linux:** Fedora, RHEL / UBI
**Tooling:** Git, GitHub Actions, Ansible, JFrog Artifactory
**Observability:** Grafana, Prometheus, Splunk

## 📊 What You'll Find Here
- Container image tooling and experiments
- Automation scripts and platform helpers
- Proof-of-concepts for observability and metrics
- Notes and explorations around modern infrastructure

## 🚀 Current Focus
- Building my public profile. Most of what I do stays within the corporate walls.
- Building out my home lab.
- Developing scripts for my personal builds

## 🤝 Collaboration
I enjoy working with engineers who care about:
- Clean abstractions
- Pragmatic security
- Documentation that actually helps
- Systems that scale socially, not just technically.

Outside of work: Drinking coffee, hanging with the family, binge-watching old action movies


If something here helps you-or you want to compare notes-feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.
